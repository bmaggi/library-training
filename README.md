:warning: 
 - This is material used for training and example, it shouldn't be taken as an architectural reference:
	- profile plugin shouldn't have any dependencies to Papyrus
	- tests should be done using one fragment for each plugin
	- elementtype should be hosted in an independant plugin
	- ui element should probably be grouped in the same plugin
 - Built against Eclipse Neon (This example is only tested against Eclipse Neon release train)
